# NordIQuEst Project Final Event: A Milestone in Quantum Computing

The Nordic-Estonian Quantum Computing e-Infrastructure Quest, NordIQuEst, came to an end in March 2025. The three-year-long NeIC-funded initiative aimed at creating a virtual quantum computing platform tailored to the needs of the Nordic region. The project has been all about fostering cross-border collaboration and spreading expertise in quantum computing coupled to traditional high-performance computing. NordIQuEst brought together a consortium of seven partners from five NeIC countries (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, and Sweden), each contributing complementary expertise and resources to lay the foundation for this new hybrid approach to computing.

# An impactful project

The NordIQuEst project made significant strides in advancing quantum computing in the Nordic region. One of the standout achievements is the creation of a public application library. This library is a treasure trove of updated project documentation on connecting different HPC and QC resources. It also includes a collection of quantum computing algorithms and guidelines on installing and running simulators on the project HPC systems, all freely accessible to anyone interested.
Training activities have been a cornerstone of the project, strengthening Nordic collaboration and boosting the competencies of users in the region. Events like the Quantum Autumn School, co-organised with EuroCC Sweden (ENCCS) and The Wallenberg Centre for Quantum Technologies (WACQT) have provided fantastic opportunities to expand cross-border partnerships and engage with industry experts. Plus, all the training materials are freely available in the NordIQuEst Application Library, making it a valuable resource for anyone looking to dive into quantum computing.
Additionally, the project has launched a branded portal where users can access the infrastructure and resources developed during the project. While the platform is not currently open to external users for direct access to quantum computers, the experience accrued will be directly utilised in the future. The portal provides comprehensive documentation and tools that can help users understand and connect with the available HPC and QC resources. This ensures that the knowledge and advancements made during the project are accessible to a wider audience, fostering further collaboration and learning.
The project has also positioned the Nordic countries as pioneers in the European quantum computing landscape. The first cross-border hybrid HPC+QC job was executed already in 2022, connecting the LUMI supercomputer in Finland with the QAL 9000 quantum computer in Sweden. NordIQuEst has equipped the partners with the know-how to guide similar endeavours now taking place on a larger scale across Europe and beyond.

# Continuing the Journey

The NordIQuEst project will continue with a second iteration starting in August 2025. This next phase will focus on creating a forum for discussion, conducting landscaping analyses, and seeking new funding for enabling even tighter collaboration. The application library will be kept up to date. We hope to also continue with training events to foster the growth of quantum computing users’ competencies and further engage the industry sector, to further increase the competitiveness of the Nordics. The ultimate goal is to create a unified ecosystem for quantum computing in the Nordic region, building on the strong foundation laid by the initial project. NordIQuEst exemplified the strength of Nordic collaboration – the journey has just begun!
