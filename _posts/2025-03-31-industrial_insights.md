Industrial Perspectives on the Adoption of Quantum Computing: Insights from the NordIQuEst Survey

Quantum computing is making waves across industries, with businesses exploring its potential for computational breakthroughs. To better understand how industry professionals engage with this emerging technology, the NordIQuEst project conducted a survey, revealing key insights into tools, resources, and challenges in adopting quantum computing.

The survey found that nearly all respondents reported their businesses are actively involved in quantum computing, highlighting significant industry interest. Most participants focus on quantum software development, followed by hardware development and strategic roles, with some also evaluating business applications. Qiskit emerged as the most commonly used tool, while other frameworks like Pennylane, QIBO, and AWS Braket also saw adoption. In terms of computing resources, 90% of respondents rely on personal computers for quantum-related tasks, though 63% also leverage cloud computing resources.

A substantial 80% of respondents employ computational modeling in various fields, including logistics, fluid dynamics, and quantum system simulations. Most participants (16 out of 19) have accessed real quantum computers, primarily through cloud platforms such as IBM Quantum, D-Wave, and Amazon Braket. Over half of the participants consider quantum simulators and hardware essential to their work, with none viewing them as irrelevant.

Despite this enthusiasm, the survey highlighted several challenges that must be addressed for broader industry adoption. Accessibility remains a major concern, as 84% of participants emphasized the need for easy setup and access to quantum hardware and simulators to evaluate their business value. Collaboration with domain experts was identified as another critical factor, with 74% of respondents indicating that such partnerships would help accelerate adoption. Additionally, awareness of existing initiatives remains low - over half of the participants were unaware of the NordIQuEst project before taking the survey, signaling a need for greater outreach and education.

To bridge these gaps, industry stakeholders and research initiatives should focus on simplifying access to quantum computing, fostering collaboration between experts and industry professionals, and expanding education and awareness efforts. As quantum technology continues to evolve, addressing these challenges will be crucial in unlocking its full potential for industrial applications.
