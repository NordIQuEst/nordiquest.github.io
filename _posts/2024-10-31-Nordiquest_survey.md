We're excited to introduce you to the NordIQuEst project, an initiative funded by NeIC (Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration). The purpose of the project is to build a Nordic-Estonian e-infrastructure which combines high-performance computing and quantum computing from across Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Estonia.
 
As part of our efforts, we kindly invite you to share your insights through a brief and anonymous survey. Your feedback will be instrumental in shaping our approach to an integrated HPC-QC system and aligning it with the needs of industry leaders like yourself. Your feedback will be an essential guide in our project's implementation.
 
Simply access our quick, anonymous survey by following this link: the survey is closed, thank you for your help!

It should only take about 10 minutes to complete. Deadline for answers was 2024-11-24.
 
Your valuable input is the cornerstone of our project's success, and we deeply appreciate your contribution. 
 
Thank you in advance for your participation in the survey of the NordIQuEst project.

NordIQuEst Project Team
