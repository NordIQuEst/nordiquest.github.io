## Frequently asked questions

*	**What does NordIQuEst do?**

We work to create a unified environment of several Nordic quantum computers coupled with traditional supercomputing resources. The end goal is a multinational quantum computing platform customized for the needs of the Nordic region.


*	**Does NordIQuEst develop quantum computers?**

No, we do not develop or build quantum computers. Our focus lies in creating a functional ecosystem composed of supercomputers and quantum computers.


*	**Why do we want to combine quantum computers and supercomputers?**

Quantum computers alone are not suitable for every type of problem. In practical applications, already powerful classical supercomputers are further accelerated by performing expensive computational subroutines on quantum computers.


*	**Who should be interested in NordIQuEst?**

Nordic-Estonian Quantum Computing e-Infrastructure is aimed at researchers and developers in Nordic countries, either academia or industry, to provide competitive computing resources for R&D.

*	**Do I need to have experience in quantum computing to use the NordIQuEst quantum computing ecosystem?**

NordIQuEst's quantum computing ecosystem is completely accessible even to beginners in quantum computing. We support the most popular quantum programming tools, for which many tutorials can be found online. The platform is also suitable for education, and we have organized introductory courses on quantum computing, the material of which is available online. We also have our own quantum algorithm library with some ready-to-use examples to get started with.

* 	**Can I access the NordIQuEst infrastructure via my personal computer?**

Unfortunately, continuous access to the NordIQuEst quantum computers is not available at the moment. We provide training events in which participants can experience the current infrastructure and run algorithms on the Quantum Computers involved in the project. You can also check our application library if you are interested in understanding what is currently available in the NordIQuEst infrastructure.  

*	**What is the pricing of NordIQuEst services?**

The goal of NordIQuEst is to be free from commercial interests. When the infrastructure will become publicly available, this stance will be reflected in the pricing of our services.
