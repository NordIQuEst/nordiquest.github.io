## Frequently asked questions

1.	What does NordIQuEst do?
We work to create a unified environment of several Nordic quantum computers coupled with traditional supercomputing resources. The end goal is a multinational quantum computing platform customized for the needs of the Nordic region.


2.	Does NordIQuEst develop quantum computers?
No, we do not develop or build quantum computers. Our focus lies in creating a functional ecosystem composed of supercomputers and quantum computers.


3.	Why do we want to combine quantum computers and supercomputers?
Quantum computers alone are not suitable for every type of problem. In practical applications, already powerful classical supercomputers are further accelerated by performing expensive computational subroutines on quantum computers.


4.	Who should be interested in NordIQuEst?
Nordic-Estonian Quantum Computing e-Infrastructure is aimed at researchers and developers in Nordic countries, either academia or industry, to provide competitive computing resources for R&D.
